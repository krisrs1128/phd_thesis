\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

I am grateful to the many people who contributed to my intellectual development
throughout the PhD.

Most importantly, I want to thank my advisor, Susan Holmes. She offered
motivation and valuable perspective for all the projects discussed in this
thesis, and I look to her for examples of how a true scholar works and thinks.

I also want to thank a mentor, Lester Mackey, who shaped my view of statistics
and whose guidance made my PhD journey that much more exciting and meaningful.

To my community -- friends, officemates, labmates, and project co-conspirators
-- thank you for helping me feel like I belonged.

I am grateful for the effort of members in the Relman, Hsing, Bhatt, and Howe
labs, for ensuring smooth and fruitful collaborations.

I appreciate the funding my work has received through an NIH training grant (T32
GM 96982-5) and a Stanford University Weiland fellowship.

Finally, I want to thank my family, Siva, Dalila, and Jasmine (and Ewok...), who
were always around when I needed it.
